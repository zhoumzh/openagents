"""Archive orphaned per-routine channels.

Backend commit ad061c2c (May 2026) briefly switched routines to
per-routine channels named `routine:<routine-id>`. That design has
been reverted in favour of one routine channel per agent
(`routines:<agent>`) — same convention as before — so the user-facing
Inbox stays grouped by agent. Any `routine:<id>` channels created
under the old design no longer receive new fires; archive them so they
drop out of the Chats / Inbox surfaces while preserving message
history for forensics.
