"""
ONM Event Envelope — the universal unit of communication.

This module defines the event structure from the OpenAgents Network Model (ONM).
Every interaction in a network is an event. There are no separate concepts for
"messages," "commands," or "notifications" — they are all events with different types.

This is distinct from the legacy models.event.Event which is used by the existing
SDK runtime. The ONM event model will eventually replace it.
