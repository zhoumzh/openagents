All notable changes to the OpenAgents project will be documented in this file.

## [0.6.9] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- Complete local workspace integration (Frontend & Backend run locally)
- Configurable Workspace Endpoint within the Launcher Settings UI
- Hot-reloading of the AgentConnector when the Workspace Endpoint is changed
- `dev-local-frontend` and `dev-local-backend` Makefile targets
- Implemented workspace deletion feature in Launcher (UI and IPC) to remove local configurations and perform remote soft-deletion.
- Added `deleteWorkspace` method to `WorkspaceClient` to handle backend soft-delete API.
- Added fallback logic in `loadCore` within `AgentManager` to prioritize local source `agent-connector` during development to prevent dependency caching issues.
